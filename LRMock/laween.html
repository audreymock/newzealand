<h1>When an Internship Abroad Isn't</h1>
<img src="panorama.png" height="200">
I should be in Aotearoa New Zealand right now.  It is currently June of 2020,
the middle of a summer which will be memorable for the rest of my life.  Before
I finalized my (incredibly expensive) flights to New Zealand, my parents wanted
me to check with the travel agency to ensure that I would not pay full price
for the tickets if I needed to delay or cancel them for any reason.  At the
time, I thought this was silly--I had been looking forward to studying abroad
for years and diligently planning this experience for months, and nothing
could change that.  They reminded me that I could get very sick, or we could
have a family emergency...not things I wanted to think about, but the
possibility was real.  I reluctantly agreed and confirmed that the flights
I booked were insured.<br><br>

I never could have imagined that during the semester I chose to study abroad, there would be a pandemic; a deadly virus that had led to an outbreak before I even left, actually, but not something that I ever thought would impact me in any way.  Against all odds, I ended up studying abroad during a global crisis.<br><br>

After two and a half incredible months in New Zealand, I was sent home to the United States.  This experience was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, but hopefully not defined by it; it would be a shame to focus on its end rather than its duration.  This is my unexpected story, from Auckland to Boston.<br><br>
