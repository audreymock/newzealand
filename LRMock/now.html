<h1>Where Does this Leave Me?</h1>

At the end of all of this, I had a fantastic two and a half months abroad.  I learned a lot about my field, my interests, my career goals, New Zealand, and myself.  While a pandemic may be a particularly unlikely occurrence, the rest of my life will not go as planned--that is the one thing that I can plan on with certainty.  It is understandable to be upset when these things happen, but it is my response to these issues that will be important.  I learned from the early conclusion of my study abroad experience just as I learned from my time abroad.  I am so thankful to have lived, studied, and worked in New Zealand and will focus on the overwhelmingly positive aspects of my experience.
